# IOTA C# Library

This is an unofficial C#-Library that targets .NET Standard 2.0. That means it can be used within .NET Framework-, .NET Core- and Xamarin-Projects.

## Getting Started

This is how you create the API you can use within your projects:

```csharp
   IotaApi iotaApi = new IotaApi("nodes.thetangle.org", 443);
   //...
```
## Additional Notes and Credits

I created this API to reach more developers creating great stuff based on Iota. Since C# is a very clean and powerfull language this API is a great way to learn how Iota works under the hood.
Please note that the Iota project is still in Beta and so is this API. (I am not responsible for any kind of loss of your Iota ;))
